QuaBot is the perfect Discord bot, it has advanced modules ranging from Giveaways, Reactionroles, logging to applications and so much more.

## QuaBot
Is the best all in one Discord bot. With a wide variaty of modules it is one of the best multipurpose bots out there. Some of our modules include:
- Reaction Roles
- Giveaways
- Logging
- Moderation
- Custom Applications
- Levels

We have put a lot of effort into our [dashboard](https://quabot.net/login), allowing you to edit and tweak modules to your liking, all one the web. It has a nice set of features with a great user experience.

We aim to use Discord's interactions as much as possible. That's why all commands are *slash commands*, and we try to use *buttons*, *modals* and *select menus* as much as possible. We also support the new *context menus*, so if you want to punish users my right-clicking on their profile, you can do that with QuaBot! Just hover over the *Apps* tab and use the commands.
